# KARicco
This repo holds images, scripts, and styles for K.A. Ricco Hair Design. 

This is necessary because the site is hosted on Square Online powered by Weebly. This system is extremely limited without the power and usability available on Weebly. It is also completely incompatible with Weebly.

To create the approved design that was created and facilitated through Weebly I have written custom styles hosted in this repo. 

To get these styles and other content into the site beyond the very limited abilities of the system I have written a script to inject content and manage the injection of content and classes.

Square Online does not have any folder or bucket system for storing images so this repo is also holding images to be injected and used in the final design.

To facilitate adding this script to manage the injections I have utilized the method documented in this blog (https://codeandtonic.com/blog/make-any-custom-designs-in-square-online-with-custom-css-2022)
